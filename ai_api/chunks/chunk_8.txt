[00:24:24] and arguably also one of the best places, to see the change of seasons. [00:24:32] Also in the garden, you can find this small [00:24:35] Japanese tea house. [00:24:37] Where you can experience a traditional Japanese tea ceremony, [00:24:40] if you're interested. [00:24:47] Right outside the garden, [00:24:49] you can also find Hakuichi, [00:24:51] who sells the gold leaf-covered soft serve. [00:24:54] Being in Kanazawa I had no option but to try it [00:25:02] Higashi Chaya is one of three historic tea house districts in Kanazawa, [00:25:07] here geishas used to entertain the wealthy of the city, with traditional dancing, music, and drinking games. [00:25:14] While many of the buildings have been converted to restaurants and shops, [00:25:18] it's still a place to visit when in Kanazawa. [00:25:23] While researching Kanazawa, I heard about this place, [00:25:26] which served a black miso ramen, [00:25:29] and being a ramen lover myself, I just knew I had to give it a try. [00:25:33] It's a small ramen shop, specialized in miso ramen. [00:25:37] You can get the miso in three different flavors and colors. [00:25:40] I opted for black miso, which uses squid ink. [00:25:50] As we walk back to our hotel, [00:25:52] the last place we stopped by was at the Tsuzumi Gate, [00:25:56] the iconic red gate and unofficial symbol of Kanazawa. [00:26:01] Here, you can often find live street performances, as we experienced during our trip. [00:26:21] Takayama is a small city, [00:26:23] located in the mountainous Hida region of Gifu. [00:26:27] The small city is especially known for its carpentry, [00:26:30] as well as its famous Hida beef and sake. [00:26:33] Due to its location. [00:26:34] It's also a place near many onsen hot spots, [00:26:37] which was the main reason for our visit [00:26:40] We started the day exploring the old town, [00:26:42] where there was a daily morning market [00:26:54] We also visted the Takayama Jinya, [00:26:57] an old government building [00:26:58] and former headquarters of the Hida province. [00:27:18] We then ended up at Sanmachi-suji, [00:27:21] a quaint historic neighborhood [00:27:23] filled with traditional merchant houses, and sake breweries. [00:27:27] It's the place for trying the city's famous sake, [00:27:30] if you're interested. [00:27:34] Takayama is often a popular stop on the way [00:27:36] on the way to the famous Shirakawa-go [00:27:40] If you, however, don't have the time to visit, [00:27:42] like us. [00:27:43] You can instead visit the Hida folk village,
