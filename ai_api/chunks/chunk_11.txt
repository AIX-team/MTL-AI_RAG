find the perfect sourvenir. [00:34:43] On our last day in Tokyo. [00:34:45] We decided to visit Teamlab Borderless, [00:34:51] a digital art museum with several unique exhibits on display. [00:34:55] Here are some highlights. [00:34:59] Borderless world, for its waterfall inspired artwork. [00:35:10] There's also the crystal world [00:35:12] which features thousands upon thousands [00:35:15] of colorful LED lights. [00:35:24] The Forest of Lamps [00:35:25] is probably the most popular display here in the borderless museum, [00:35:30] so do expect long queues. [00:35:42] I also want to give a quick mention to the En Tea House, [00:35:47] which displays a digital artwork on your tea. [00:35:56] After Teamlab, we head to one of many popular and atmospheric alleyways of Tokyo [00:36:01] Omoide Yokocho, also known as "Memory Lane" [00:36:06] It's a narrow and atmospheric alleyway, [00:36:08] filled by small eateries, [00:36:09] paper lanterns, [00:36:11] fake maple leaves, [00:36:12] and the grilling smell of yakitori. [00:36:16] My advice is to explore the many izakayas [00:36:18] and try anything that might interest you. [00:36:21] If you have more time or just looking for different things to do, [00:36:24] here's a short list. [00:36:27] The iconic Tokyo tower. [00:36:29] A symbol of Japan's post-war rebirth. [00:36:38] The ancient Senso-ji temple, [00:36:40] the oldest temple in Tokyo. [00:36:48] Kabukicho, [00:36:49] the famous entertainment district found in Shinjuku [00:37:10] Now this video wouldn't be complete without a full budget breakdown. [00:37:15] The total cost for two people during this two week trip [00:37:18] was around $3100. [00:37:28] So that was my two week trip to Japan. [00:37:31] I don't think I'll ever get tired of visiting this country, [00:37:35] and I hope things get better around the world soon, [00:37:37] so we can all travel again. [00:37:39] But more importantly, I hope this video was helpful [00:37:42] or at least gave some inspiration, [00:37:44] if you're planning a trip to Japan yourself. [00:37:47] But if you have any questions or feedback [00:37:50] then do leave them in the comments below [00:37:52] and I'll try to get back to you. [00:37:54] But until then, [00:37:55] stay safe out there, [00:37:56] and here's hoping for a better year ahead.
