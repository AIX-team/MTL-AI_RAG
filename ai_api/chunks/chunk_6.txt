are over 100s stalls and shops in Nishiki. [00:17:02] Selling local dishes, seafood, and produce. [00:17:18] Gion, [00:17:19] is the traditional entertainment district of Kyoto, [00:17:22] and one of the major tourist areas. [00:17:27] The best way to explore Gion is to simply walk the many historic streets such as [00:17:36] In addition, Hanami-koji is a street famous for its tea houses, [00:17:40] and the place to catch a glimpse of a working geisha [00:17:49] The next morning we head to another popular destination, [00:17:52] the Fushimi Inari shrine. [00:17:55] It's a shrine dedicated to Inari, [00:17:57] the Shinto god of rice, [00:17:59] and its famous for its 1000s of torii gates. [00:18:03] As you can see it gets extremely crowded, [00:18:06] but the further you walk up, the lesser the crowds become. [00:18:13] We heard that temples are usually great places to watch the autumn foliage. [00:18:18] First up, is Nanzen-ji, [00:18:20] famous for the large aqueduct, [00:18:22] and the surrounding temple area. [00:18:42] Next door. We find Eikan-do temple. [00:18:45] A famous autumn foliage spot, thanks to its pristine garden. [00:19:05] The last place we visited while in Kyoto, [00:19:08] is the small alley of Pontocho. [00:19:11] Famous for its atmospheric dining area, [00:19:14] filled with restaurants and bars, [00:19:16] we decided to grab our last meal here, [00:19:18] and tried some very expensive beef. [00:19:21] And yes. It was definitely worth the price. [00:19:25] Got more time in Kyoto? [00:19:26] Well, here's a few extras. [00:19:51] We have to board the JR Thunderbird Limited Express. [00:19:55] It would take around 2 hours to reach Kanazawa. [00:19:58] This was the perfect opportunity to try out the many bento box train meals, [00:20:04] which was sold at the various stations across Japan. [00:20:10] Kanazawa is often called "Little Kyoto", [00:20:13] and one can see why since the city has maintained many well-kept historic districts. [00:20:20] The city is also renown for its gold leaf production, [00:20:23] being responsible for over 99% of Japan's output. [00:20:29] Throw in some great art museums and one of the best gardens in the country, [00:20:33] And Kanazawa is quite the hidden gem. [00:20:36] Although most of the main sights are centrally located, [00:20:39] meaning, walking is doable. [00:20:41] Buses are still the main way to get around. [00:20:45] You can use an IC card on the JR Machi bus line. [00:20:48] But other lines require a local one-day pass or paying for
