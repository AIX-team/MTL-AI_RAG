[00:27:45] which is an open-air museum [00:27:47] that display various similar mountain village houses [00:27:50] found in Shirakawa-go. [00:28:02] It was now time for us to our ryokan. [00:28:05] We toke a bus to Okuhida onsen [00:28:07] and arrive at our ryokan for the night. [00:28:13] The ryokan comes with traditional Japanese rooms [00:28:17] with the option of having your own private onsen, [00:28:20] as well as access to rooftop onsen. [00:28:31] Before we toke a dip, [00:28:33] we head down for dinner [00:28:34] which was a Japanese Kaiseki, [00:28:37] a multi-course meal. [00:28:46] Heading back up to our room after dinner, [00:28:47] we were pleasantly surprised with the room being prepared for a good night's sleep. [00:28:52] I know this is a customary thing in a ryokan. [00:28:56] But still I thought it was nice. [00:28:58] But instead of calling it a night, [00:29:00] we head up to the rooftop onsen. [00:29:02] There are two separate onsens to try, and we had it, pretty much, all to ourselves. [00:29:07] Despite the slight rain and clouds covering the night sky, [00:29:10] it was still a decent experience. [00:29:22] Next morning, we decided to wake up early [00:29:25] and enjoy our last moments with our onsen. [00:29:30] The morning light did a great job in revealing the beautiful landscape [00:29:34] that we missed during last night. [00:29:47] We then headed down for a quick breakfast, [00:29:50] before checking out. [00:29:58] Before we embark on our long trip to Tokyo, [00:30:01] we decided to visit the Shinhotaka Ropeway. [00:30:05] It's one of the most popular sightseeing spots in all of Gifu. [00:30:09] The ropeway ascends nearly 1000 meters [00:30:12] to a mountaintop observatory [00:30:14] offering panoramic view of Japan's Northern Alps. [00:30:18] A place I'm looking forward to revisit on another date. [00:30:35] We board the Shinkansen bullet train [00:30:38] and head to our final destination of this trip, [00:30:40] Tokyo. [00:30:43] Skyscrapers, [00:30:44] bright lights, [00:30:45] busy, [00:30:46] and efficient. [00:30:47] There isn't much to say about Tokyo, which hasn't already been said. [00:30:51] It's a modern super city, [00:30:53] packed with sights and activities that would keep any traveler busy for weeks. [00:31:01] During our time in Tokyo, we stayed at the Tokyo Zen Capsule hotel. [00:31:06] While I've stayed at capsule hotels before, this place was a bit more unique. [00:31:10] Inspired by traditional Japanese rooms, each capsule was afforded a lot more space [00:31:16] than your regular
