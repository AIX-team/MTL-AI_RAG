purchase a specific local ticket. [00:02:17] A quick word on the Japan Rail pass. [00:02:20] If you follow this itinerary strictly, [00:02:22] you will not be needing the JR Pass [00:02:25] A JR Pass is great if you're planning to do a round-trip. [00:02:28] Since it will cover the return trip expenses. [00:02:31] But since this is a point-to-point trip, [00:02:32] meaning we're starting in Osaka and finishing in Tokyo. [00:02:35] It's actually more affordable going with single-fare tickets [00:02:40] For navigation, I've always been using Google Maps in Japan, [00:02:43] it works well, and even tells you the connections you'll need to make [00:02:47] For more detailed information and planning ahead, [00:02:51] I recommend checking out the website HyperDia. [00:02:57] We begin our journey in Osaka. [00:03:00] Osaka is known for being the kitchen of Japan. [00:03:03] With many of the nation's favorite dishes, originating from the city. [00:03:07] It's a modern and lively place. [00:03:09] Where the focus is on having a good time. [00:03:12] People just seem to speak louder here, [00:03:14] eat louder, and drink more. [00:03:17] Not that I'm complaining. [00:03:20] We arrived quite late in Osaka [00:03:22] and head towards our hotel. [00:03:25] After dropping off our belongings. [00:03:27] We immediately head to the Dotonbori area in downtown Osaka. [00:03:32] The area is known for the Glico-Man sign, [00:03:34] and being a busy tourist spot with neon lights, shops, and plenty of food options. [00:03:40] We explore the area and pick up a few treats along the way. [00:03:43] But it was time for a meal, and we head to the ever popular Ichiran ramen, [00:03:48] for it's tonkotsu ramen. [00:03:52] It was Lisa's first time here, and she definitely approves. [00:03:58] The next day, we spent the morning at the Namba Yasaka shrine. [00:04:02] It's a small shrine famous for its lion head stage [00:04:10] If you plan to visit a lot of shrines and temples in Japan, [00:04:13] then it's always a good idea to know how to pay your respects [00:04:17] Here's a quick how-to. [00:04:18] First, ring the bell if there is one. [00:04:20] Bow twice. [00:04:23] Clap twice. [00:04:25] And bow once. [00:04:29] After finishing up at the shrine. [00:04:31] We arrive at the Osaka Castle [00:04:34] The castle is one of Japan's most famous landmarks. [00:04:37] And it played a major role in the unification of Japan during the 16th century.
