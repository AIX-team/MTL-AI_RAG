now serves as the end destination for the old Choishi Michi pilgrimage trail. [00:09:00] From Daimon Gate, we head to Kongobu-ji, [00:09:03] the head temple of Shingon Buddhism in Koyasan. [00:09:07] We explore its many halls and corridors, [00:09:10] as well as Banryutei, Japan's largest rock garden, [00:09:13] which supposedly should resemble, [00:09:15] a pair of dragons emerging from a sea of clouds. [00:09:27] We grab a quick snack from the local convenience store, [00:09:31] and then decide to head to the main attraction of Koyasan, [00:09:35] Okunoin Cemetery. [00:09:37] This misty and mossy cemetery is Japans largest, [00:09:41] stretching over 2 km and is home to over 200,000 graves. [00:09:48] It's serene and peaceful place, [00:09:50] and I highly recommend taking an hour or so to simply explore. [00:09:59] Okunoin is also home to the Kobo Daishi Mausoleum, [00:10:03] this is where Kobo Daishi is said to be in an eternal meditation. [00:10:08] There are no photos or video allowed after the bridge, [00:10:12] so you'll just have to visit yourself to see. [00:10:18] As the evening hours arrive, we head back to our temple lodging, [00:10:22] where we're greeted with a traditional Buddhist meal. [00:10:28] The meal itself is strictly vegetarian, [00:10:30] and resembles of that of the traditional Kaiseki-style dinner [00:10:44] If you decide to stay at a temple, [00:10:46] then don't forget to attend the morning ritual to complete the experience. [00:10:59] Next, we head to Nara, [00:11:02] a city nestled between Osaka and Kyoto. [00:11:06] The city is most known for its park with the very same name, [00:11:09] and the many deer that roam the surrounding area. [00:11:13] If you're interested in feeding one or two, [00:11:16] crackers can be purchased from local vendors around the park, [00:11:20] the deer will politely thank you for it. [00:11:34] The first place to visit in Nara is the great temple of Todai-ji. [00:11:40] It houses the Buddha statue Nara Daibatsu, [00:11:43] which is the largest bronze statue in the world. [00:11:47] While exploring the temple, we also come across this square hole in a pillar, [00:11:51] known as Buddha's Nostril. [00:11:53] It's said to bring good health and luck if you manage to crawl through it. [00:11:59] As we explore the park further, [00:12:00] we come across Kasuga-Taisha. [00:12:03] A Shinto shrine known for it's 100s of bronze lanterns. [00:12:06] Many of which have been donated by worshippers throughout the years. [00:12:12] The lanterns are
