only lit twice a year during two lantern festivals, [00:12:16] One in February, [00:12:17] and one in August. [00:12:24] We decided to get a little bit of exercise and climb Mount Wakakusa, [00:12:29] a 342 meters tall hill located in the park. [00:12:35] Just climbing, [00:12:36] the little hill or mountain, [00:12:39] here's in Nara. [00:12:40] Lisa's right behind me. [00:12:42] It's quite a little climb. But... [00:12:45] Nothing too tough and... [00:12:47] Well worth... [00:12:49] the little climb, [00:12:50] to get an excellent view, [00:12:52] over the city and the Nara park. [00:13:11] After walking around so much we needed a quick bite, [00:13:14] and you can't come to Nara without witnessing, [00:13:18] the famous mochi-pounding show from this small mochi shop. [00:13:23] The mochi was also excellent. [00:13:36] For more things to do in Nara, [00:13:38] try the following. [00:13:58] Kyoto, the ancient capital of Japan, [00:14:02] home to a number of important temples, shrines, palaces, and gardens. [00:14:06] The city is, therefore, a major tourist destination, [00:14:09] second only to Tokyo. [00:14:13] We board an early morning train to Arashiyama, [00:14:16] an area known for its natural scenery. [00:14:23] The first place to visit here is the Arashiyama Bamboo Grove [00:14:57] Right next to the bamboo grove, [00:14:58] you'll find Tenryu-ji, [00:15:00] one of the most important temples in Kyoto, [00:15:04] as well as having one of the finest gardens in the entire city. [00:15:15] From Tenryu-ji. We walk along the Katsura river, [00:15:18] the main river that runs through Arashiyama. [00:15:22] From there we take a short walk up to the lovely Senko-ji temple [00:15:26] This is arguably a bit of a hidden gem in Arashiyama. [00:15:30] The temple provides a great view as well as the chance to meet the local temple dog. [00:15:53] One cannot visit Arashiyama, [00:15:55] without coming across the Iwatayama Monkey Park, [00:15:58] Home to over 100 Japanese snow monkeys. [00:16:17] As we finish up with Arashiyama, [00:16:19] we also make a quick stop at Kinkaku-Ji. [00:16:22] Currently, a temple, [00:16:23] it was formerly used as a retirement villa for a shogun. [00:16:35] For dinner, we craved a bowl of ramen, [00:16:38] and one of the best places in Kyoto, [00:16:40] is Ramen Sen no Kaze. [00:16:42] It's quite a well-known ramen shop so do expect a que during dining hours. [00:16:53] We start the next day exploring the Nishiki Market. [00:16:57] A well-known food market in Kyoto. [00:16:59] There
