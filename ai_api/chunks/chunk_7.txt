the fare. [00:20:57] We decided to visit the Omicho market since it was close to our hotel. [00:21:02] The market has a 300 year history dating back to the Edo period. [00:21:06] Now it's a popular food market with over 170 stalls, [00:21:10] earning its title "The Kitchen of Kanazawa". [00:21:17] We opted for a quick lunch at the very popular Mori Mori Sushi [00:21:21] A well-known conveyor belt sushi restaurant residing in the market. [00:21:26] Ordering like many other places in Japan, is done through a tablet, [00:21:30] or you can simply grab a dish from the conveyor belt itself. [00:21:44] Kanazawa has plenty of museums. [00:21:47] But one that caught my attention in particular, [00:21:49] was the D.T. Suzuki museum. [00:21:52] The museum was opened to celebrate the life and work of Suzuki "Daisetz" Teitaro. [00:21:57] A prominent Zen Buddhist. [00:22:12] A more popular museum and one of the big attractions in Kanazawa, [00:22:16] is the 21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art. [00:22:20] It's a much larger museum compared to the D.T. Suzuki, [00:22:24] and you can easily get lost for hours exploring the many halls and exhibits. [00:22:45] For dinner, [00:22:45] we decided to visit a small cozy sushi shop called Sushi Ippei. [00:22:51] The restaurant was run by an elderly couple, [00:22:54] And the elderly woman was especially friendly and attentive, [00:22:57] explaining any noteworthy sushi pieces. [00:23:00] - This shell fish only in Kanazawa. [00:23:03] - Only in Kanazawa. - Local, local shellfish. [00:23:05] - Oh okay. [00:23:05] - Not in another place. [00:23:06] - Ah okay. - Only here. [00:23:08] - Only here. [00:23:09] - No soy sauce. [00:23:10] - Just eat. Okay. [00:23:20] Our goal for the following day, [00:23:21] was to visit the last essential places on our Kanazawa to-do list. [00:23:27] We start off visiting the Oyama Shrine. [00:23:30] During our visit, [00:23:31] we were lucky enough to witness a wedding ceremony being held at the shrine. [00:23:44] From the shrine, we toke a short walk up to the Kanazawa Castle. [00:23:49] A partially restored castle, [00:23:51] it was the seat of the powerful Maeda clan. [00:24:02] After walking through the castle grounds, [00:24:04] we reach the Kenrouku-en garden. [00:24:08] The garden is particularly known for these protective ropes, [00:24:12] which are tied in a cone shape around the trees, [00:24:15] to provide support when the season shifts to winter. [00:24:21] It's one of the most beautiful gardens in Japan,
