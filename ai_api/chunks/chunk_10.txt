capsule, [00:31:18] which made the stay more comfortable. [00:31:21] The hotel came with the expected amenities, so overall it was an enjoyable stay. [00:31:30] On our first day in Tokyo, [00:31:31] we decided to visit the Meiji Shrine. [00:31:34] The entrance is marked by a large torii gate [00:31:38] and leads into a forest area where the shrine resides. [00:31:42] The shrine is dedicated to the deified spirits of Emperor Meiji and his wife. [00:31:47] It's one of the most popular shrines in Japan [00:31:50] and welcomes over 3 million visitors a year. [00:32:01] Not far from the shrine. You'll find Harajuku. [00:32:04] The center of Harajuku is Takeshita street, [00:32:07] with its many side streets lined up by trendy shops, [00:32:10] fashion boutiques, and fast food stores, [00:32:13] all geared towards the trendy youths of Tokyo. [00:32:20] Within Harajuku, we decide to visit a small cafe, [00:32:23] where the main attraction is spending some time with micro pigs. [00:32:28] It's my first time being in such as cafe, [00:32:31] but animal centric cafes are very common in Tokyo. [00:32:35] Just don't expect too much from the beverage list, [00:32:38] which to be honest, isn't really the point of visiting cafes such as this. [00:32:45] From Mipig Cafe, we head down to the famous Shibuya crossing, [00:32:50] a popular scramble crossing in Shibuya, [00:32:53] and at peak hours 1000s of pedestrians [00:32:55] scramble across, what many believe to be the worlds busiest crosswalk. [00:33:01] To get a better view of the crossing, [00:33:03] we head up to the Mag's Park building, [00:33:05] where you can get access to an excellent rooftop view [00:33:08] of the crossing below. [00:33:24] As hunger strikes, we dive into the popular sushi chain Uobei Sushi. [00:33:29] Known for its budget friendly prices, and conveyor style system. [00:33:52] The following day, we decide to spend the entire day [00:33:55] exploring Akihabara, [00:33:57] Tokyo's famous electric town. [00:34:00] It's a buzzing commercial area, [00:34:02] mostly famous for being the center of geek culture in Japan. [00:34:06] Anime, manga, videogames, [00:34:08] and Maid cafes, [00:34:10] are in full display here. [00:34:12] Whether you're into this or not, [00:34:14] it's still an area worth exploring. [00:34:17] First, try out the many arcades in Akihabara, [00:34:21] bust out your favorite dance moves [00:34:23] or maybe win a prize if you're lucky. [00:34:28] There's also a lot of shopping that can be done here, [00:34:31] so who knows, you might
