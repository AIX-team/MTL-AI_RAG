has been known for being, [00:04:50] the center of Japanese youth culture in Osaka. [00:04:54] Similar to Harajuku of Tokyo. [00:04:56] It's here you can find the latest trendsetting fashion in Osaka [00:05:01] We opted to a little bit of shopping, to see if we could find something interesting. [00:05:12] To get a better view of the city, [00:05:14] we decided to visit the Umeda Sky building. [00:05:18] While here you can access its famous observation deck, [00:05:22] which provides a great view over the entire city of Osaka. [00:05:34] As dinner time arrives, [00:05:35] we head arguably to my favorite Okonomiyaki shop in the city, [00:05:39] Okaru. [00:05:42] Okonomiyaki, are these savoury Japanese pancakes made of flour, [00:05:46] eggs, cabbage, and the protein of your choice. [00:05:57] Don Quijote is a well known discount chain in Japan. [00:06:01] But what's unique about this one in Osaka, [00:06:03] is its Ferris wheel, which you can actually take a ride on. [00:06:07] It's rather a gimmicky experience, [00:06:09] but it does provide a view over Dotonbori. [00:06:20] If you find yourselves with more time in Osaka, [00:06:22] then here's a few more things to do. [00:06:35] An old neon-lit neighborhood south of Minami. [00:07:07] Koyasan is the name of a secluded and small temple town, nestled away in the mountains of Wakayama. [00:07:13] It's more commonly known as the center of Japan's Shingon Buddhism, [00:07:17] and home to over 100 temples in which 50 of them allow for overnight stays. [00:07:24] We decided to purchase the Koyasan World Heritage ticket, [00:07:28] which covers the entire trip to Koyasan. [00:07:32] It takes almost 2 hours to reach Koyasan from Osaka. [00:07:37] The cable car ride from Gokurakubashi station to Koyasan, [00:07:41] is clearly the highlight of the 2-hour trip. [00:07:50] After reaching the temple town, we check in at our temple lodging named Saizen-in. [00:07:55] The rooms are traditional Japanese rooms, [00:07:57] with tatami floors, sliding doors, and shared bathroom facilities. [00:08:02] So this is our temple stay for the day and night, [00:08:07] a lot more luxurious than I imagined. [00:08:14] The first place to visit was the Danjo Garan temple complex. [00:08:19] It's one of the first complexes build by Kobo Daishi, [00:08:22] and houses around 20 temples and buildings including Konpo Daito, the great pagoda. [00:08:38] Not far from the complex, you'll find the great Daimon Gate. [00:08:42] This was the original entrance to Koyasan, [00:08:45] but also
