[00:00:09] Japan is full of diverse and unique places waiting to be explored [00:00:14] For many, Japan resides on the top of the list of places to visit, [00:00:18] and I was no different. [00:00:20] Japan is one of my favorite countries to explore, [00:00:23] and I had the pleasure to visit once more. [00:00:26] I'll be traveling through this amazing country, [00:00:28] visiting 7 different cities, [00:00:30] and trying to cram all the essentials into a two-week itinerary [00:00:34] And I'll be sharing it all, [00:00:36] with the goal to help you, explore this fascinating country. [00:00:40] Here's how I spent 14 days in Japan. [00:00:46] Here's an overview of the journey ahead. [00:00:49] We arrive in Osaka, the kitchen of Japan. [00:00:51] A city famous for its love of food and nightlife. [00:00:55] We then head to the secluded temple town of Koyasan. [00:00:58] Where we'll be staying overnight at a buddhist temple. [00:01:01] Afterwards, we visit the city of Nara, [00:01:04] famous for the Nara park, [00:01:05] and its deer population. [00:01:08] From Nara we head to Kyoto. [00:01:10] The ancient capital of Japan, rich in culture and traditions. [00:01:14] After Kyoto, we jump on the train and head up to Kanazawa, [00:01:18] renown for its gold leaf production, [00:01:20] and housing one of the three great gardens in Japan. [00:01:23] We then continue to the mountainous region of Takayama. [00:01:26] Where we explore the old town and relax at a Japanese onsen. [00:01:30] And finally, our two-week journey ends with Tokyo. [00:01:34] While in the city, we spend the remaining time visiting the most essential spots. [00:01:42] Before we begin, here's a few things you'll need to know [00:01:46] We decided to visit Japan in November, [00:01:49] during the autumn season, [00:01:50] and it's by far my favorite season to visit, [00:01:53] due to the beautiful autumn foliage and mild weather conditions. [00:01:58] Public transportation will be the main way to get around. [00:02:01] For that, you'll need to get your hands on an IC card. [00:02:05] IC cards are rechargeable travel cards that can be used to pay for fares, [00:02:09] and even buy goods in some stores. [00:02:11] They work in most major cities but for more remote areas, [00:02:14] you'll need to
